# Environment Variables

## Overview

Most SForge configuration can be injected via `SFORGE_*` environment variables. CLI-only fields, such as judge CPU/memory limits, are called out below. The resolution priority is:

```
defaults  <  env vars  <  experiment YAML  <  CLI flags
```

Proxy, mirror, API key, path, backend, registry, and hub settings can be overridden at runtime.

## Build Stage Variables

These variables are passed as Docker build args during `sforge build`. They affect image construction but are **not** baked into the final image.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SFORGE_HTTP_PROXY` | HTTP proxy for Docker build |
| `SFORGE_HTTPS_PROXY` | HTTPS proxy for Docker build |
| `SFORGE_NO_PROXY` | Addresses to bypass proxy |
| `SFORGE_PYPI_INDEX_URL` | PyPI mirror URL (sets `PIP_INDEX_URL` at build time) |
| `SFORGE_MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` | Maven repository mirror (sets `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` at build time) |
| `SFORGE_GO_PROXY` | Go module proxy (sets `GOPROXY` at build time) |
| `SFORGE_APT_MIRROR_URL` | APT source mirror (rewrites `/etc/apt/sources.list` in base image) |
| `SFORGE_GIT_USER` | Git username for private repos |
| `SFORGE_GIT_TOKEN` | Git access token (injected as BuildKit secret, **not** stored in image) |
| `SFORGE_EXTRA_HOSTS` | DNS overrides during build, format: `"host1:ip1,host2:ip2"` |

### How build args work

Proxy variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) are Docker predefined build args --- they are automatically available to `RUN` commands but do not persist in the final image layer.

Package mirror variables (`PIP_INDEX_URL`, `GOPROXY`, `MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`) are declared as `ARG` directives, making them available during `RUN` but also not persisted.

## Run Stage Variables

Used when running agents via `sforge run`. These are injected as container environment variables.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SFORGE_AGENT_API_KEY` | API key passed to the selected agent using that agent's expected env var (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the `CODEX_API_KEY` compatibility alias for Codex) |
| `SFORGE_AGENT_API_BASE_URL` | API base URL override passed through the selected agent's base-url env var when it has one |
| `SFORGE_AGENT_MODEL` | Model override for the agent |
| `SFORGE_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | Agent timeout in seconds |
| `SFORGE_AGENT_EXTRA_ENV` | Extra env vars for agent container, format: `"KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2"` |
| `SFORGE_HTTP_PROXY` | HTTP proxy injected into the agent container at run time. Not recommended for normal use; incompatible with `--disable-internet`. |
| `SFORGE_HTTPS_PROXY` | HTTPS proxy injected into the agent container at run time. Not recommended for normal use; incompatible with `--disable-internet`. |
| `SFORGE_NO_PROXY` | Addresses that bypass the run-time proxy |
| `SFORGE_NODEJS_MIRROR_URL` | Node.js download mirror (used during agent runtime install) |
| `SFORGE_NPM_REGISTRY_URL` | NPM registry mirror (sets `npm_config_registry` in container) |
| `SFORGE_CLAUDE_CACHE_OPT` | Suppress Claude Code attribution header and dynamic system prompt sections for better caching on third-party proxies. Set to `1` to enable. |
| `SFORGE_CODEX_AUTH_FILE` | Host `auth.json` used only for Codex OAuth mode; defaults to `~/.codex/auth.json`. It is not required when `SFORGE_AGENT_API_KEY` is configured. |

::: warning Direct run-time proxies
Directly injecting `SFORGE_HTTP_PROXY` / `SFORGE_HTTPS_PROXY` into the agent container gives that container proxy-mediated network access. This is useful only for exceptional run-time dependency downloads and is **not recommended** for LLM API access.

It is also incompatible with network isolation (`--disable-internet`). If the agent needs to call an LLM API through a corporate proxy while network isolation is enabled, run `sforge proxy` on the host and point `SFORGE_AGENT_API_BASE_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` instead.

## Judge Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SFORGE_JUDGE_EXTRA_ENV` | Extra env vars for judge containers, format: `"KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2"` |

## Resource Limit Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SFORGE_WORK_CPU_LIMIT` | Number of CPUs for work containers (e.g., `4`) |
| `SFORGE_WORK_MEM_LIMIT` | Memory limit for work containers (e.g., `8g`) |

Judge CPU/memory limits are currently set through CLI flags (`--judge-cpu-limit`, `--judge-mem-limit`) or experiment YAML (`judge_cpu_limit`, `judge_mem_limit`), not environment variables.

## Container Backend Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SFORGE_BACKEND` | `docker` | Container backend: `docker` or `k8s` |
| `SFORGE_K8S_NAMESPACE` | `default` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `SFORGE_K8S_IMAGE_REGISTRY` | --- | Container registry for K8s image pulls |
| `SFORGE_K8S_KUBECONFIG` | --- | Path to kubeconfig file |
| `SFORGE_K8S_NODE_SELECTOR` | --- | Node selector for K8s pods, format: `"key1=val1,key2=val2"` |

## Path Variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SFORGE_LOG_DIR` | `logs/` | Override log output directory |
| `SFORGE_TASKS_DIR` | `tasks/` | Override task definitions directory |
| `SFORGE_REGISTRY` | --- | Default Docker registry URL for `pull`/`push` commands |

## Proxy Fallback Chain

For proxy variables, SForge checks multiple environment variable names in priority order:

| Config Field | Env vars checked (first match wins) |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `http_proxy` | `SFORGE_HTTP_PROXY` > `HTTP_PROXY` > `http_proxy` |
| `https_proxy` | `SFORGE_HTTPS_PROXY` > `HTTPS_PROXY` > `https_proxy` |
| `no_proxy` | `SFORGE_NO_PROXY` > `NO_PROXY` > `no_proxy` |

This means if you already have `HTTP_PROXY` set in your shell, SForge will pick it up automatically. Use the `SFORGE_` prefix to override without affecting other tools.

Because these proxy values are also injected into work containers during `sforge run`, unset them when using `--disable-internet` or use `sforge proxy` for LLM API forwarding.

## Build vs Run Decoupling

::: warning Important
Build and Run variables are completely independent. Build-stage variables are only used during `docker build` --- they are **not** baked into images. The run stage needs its own configuration.
:::

This means:

- Setting `SFORGE_PYPI_INDEX_URL` only affects `sforge build` (package installation during image construction)
- Setting `SFORGE_AGENT_API_KEY` only affects `sforge run` (agent execution)
- Proxy settings are read by both build and run stages. Run-time direct proxies are not recommended and do not work with network isolation; use `sforge proxy` for LLM API access through an upstream proxy.
